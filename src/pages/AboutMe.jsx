        My path to software development began during a transformative period in
        my life. While navigating personal challenges and rebuilding my
        foundation, I discovered my passion for coding and technology. What
        started as curiosity evolved into expertise as I immersed myself in
        learning programming languages, frameworks, and development best
        practices. This journey taught me that with dedication and perseverance,
        it's possible to completely reinvent yourself and create meaningful
        change.

        project and contribute at every level. My experience overcoming
        adversity has instilled in me a problem-solving mindset that proves
        invaluable when debugging code, optimizing performance, or finding
        creative solutions to complex technical challenges.

        experience. I bring authenticity, grit, and a deep appreciation for
        second chances to every team I join. I understand the value of
        opportunity and approach each project with genuine enthusiasm and
